            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              In my early career, I improved efficiency at a bike repair
              non-profit, and was the founding designer at a fintech startup.
              I’m looking for opportunities to design for a more equitable,
              sustainable, and healthier world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am driven to understand and impact spaces where good design is
              often overlooked. My biggest strengths are listening and working
              with uncertainty, which I believe is where the best innovation
              happens. I'm looking forward to exploring new, interesting problem
              spaces and developing a deep understanding of them over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              My community has been essential to my growth. I was one of the
              first designers at SFU Blueprint, a student-led technology agency
              that delivers tools and solutions to local nonprofits. My
              experience with Blueprint has shown me how exciting it is to work
              on real, impactful solutions with diverse and supportive teams,
              how to treat clients as partners, and how to deliver on promises.
