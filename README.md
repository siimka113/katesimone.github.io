kate's 355 website

This is kate's website for IAT 355. It is an imitation of her actual portfolio, [kate.simone.com.](https://www.katesimone.com), which is made in webflow. Here though, you will find assignments from IAT 355 under the "Visualizations" Page, the link to which can be found in the side bar on the home page. 

HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to make this website. 

For questions, email kate.simone113@gmail.com
